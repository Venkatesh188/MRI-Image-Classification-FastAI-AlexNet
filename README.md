# MRI-Image-Classification-FastAI-AlexNet
This project focuses on classifying MRI images using the FastAI library with a pretrained AlexNet model. The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate model to differentiate between various types of brain conditions based on MRI scans. The repository includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation.
